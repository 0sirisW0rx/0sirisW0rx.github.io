My first commit and a really easy project to get started. 
I wanted a free personal site that I could showcase projects on, host my resume, improve my HTML/CSS/JS skills, and get better with Git.

Steps:
  1. Create a GitHub account...
  2. Create a new public repository -- must be named yourgithubusername.github.io --
  3. Go to https://pages.github.com/ (The steps are very intuitive and instructions provided)
  4. Download GitHub Desktop or your prefered method to commit/make changes
  5. Download PyCharm CE -its free- (great for Python and HTML)
  6. Click on Set up in Desktop within your new repo (GitHub Desktop will open)
  7. Click on Open in PyCharm CE
  8. Create a new HTML file and name it index.html
  9. Edit your HTML file
  10. Your new index.html file should populate in GitHub Desktop
  11. Input a summary and description and click Commit to main
  12. Click Push origin
